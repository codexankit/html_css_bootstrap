ðŸ“Œ Small Description

This assignment is about creating and querying a simple banking database system with four main entities: Customers, Accounts, Loans, and Branches. The tasks test your understanding of SQL DDL (table creation, data types) and SQL DML (queries, joins, filtering, grouping, sorting, and aggregations). It simulates real-world scenarios like retrieving customer details, checking loan information, analyzing branch data, and handling account balances.

âœ… Key Takeaways
	1.	Database Design Basics
	â€¢	Understanding entity relationships (Customers â†” Accounts, Customers â†” Loans, Branch â†” Loans).
	â€¢	Choosing proper data types (number, string, date).
	2.	Data Definition Language (DDL)
	â€¢	Altering table structures (e.g., changing column types like account balance).
	3.	Joins & Relationships
	â€¢	Practicing joins across multiple tables (e.g., Customers with Accounts, Loans with Branches).
	â€¢	Linking foreign keys correctly (customer_id, account_id, branch_id).
	4.	Sorting & Filtering
	â€¢	Sorting by date of birth, first name, etc.
	â€¢	Filtering by conditions (city = â€˜Indiaâ€™, balance < 10000).
	5.	Aggregations & Grouping
	â€¢	Using COUNT, MAX, MIN, and GROUP BY.
	â€¢	Finding the customer with the maximum number of loans or accounts.
	6.	Subqueries & Nested Queries
	â€¢	Handling cases like customers with more than 1 account/loan or branch with maximum customers.
	7.	NULL / No Records Handling
	â€¢	Queries to display results even when no records exist (display 0 for empty cases).
	8.	Business Logic in SQL
	â€¢	Retrieving meaningful insights (e.g., customers without loans, branches with most customers).
	â€¢	Identifying anomalies (customer city vs branch city mismatch).

ðŸ‘‰ In short, this assignment strengthens your SQL skills for real-world banking/finance datasets, combining data modeling, query writing, and analytical SQL.

Would you like me to also give you the SQL solutions for all 15 queries step by step, so you can practice them directly?
