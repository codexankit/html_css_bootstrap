Got it üëç Since your focus in this assignment was mainly on point no. 7 (database connection with PostgreSQL in Java) and you already had the banking system structure, here‚Äôs the summary:

üìå Description

This project is about extending a Bank Account Management System by integrating it with a PostgreSQL database using JDBC in Java. The main goal was to implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for bank accounts through proper layering (controllers, services, helpers, exceptions) and to ensure smooth database connectivity.

You built supporting classes such as:
	‚Ä¢	AccountDBController in controllers package,
	‚Ä¢	DBException in exception package,
	‚Ä¢	ConnectionUtility in helpers package,
	‚Ä¢	IAccountDBService & IAccountService in services package,
	‚Ä¢	AccountsDBServiceImpl in serviceimpl package.

This structure ensures separation of concerns and follows good software engineering practices.

‚úÖ Key Takeaways
	1.	Database Connectivity with JDBC
	‚Ä¢	Learned how to establish a connection to PostgreSQL using Connection, DriverManager, and ConnectionUtility class.
	2.	Exception Handling
	‚Ä¢	Used a custom DBException class to gracefully handle database errors (like invalid queries, connection failures).
	3.	Layered Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Practiced separation of concerns:
	‚Ä¢	Controller ‚Üí handles user actions.
	‚Ä¢	Service ‚Üí contains business logic.
	‚Ä¢	Helper ‚Üí utility classes for DB connection.
	‚Ä¢	Exception ‚Üí centralized error handling.
	4.	Interfaces and Implementations
	‚Ä¢	Defined contracts (IAccountDBService, IAccountService) and implemented them (AccountsDBServiceImpl), encouraging scalability and testability.
	5.	CRUD Operations
	‚Ä¢	Implemented database functions:
	‚Ä¢	Create ‚Üí Add new account.
	‚Ä¢	Read ‚Üí Display account(s) by ID or all.
	‚Ä¢	Update ‚Üí Perform deposit/payment transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Delete ‚Üí Remove account by ID.
	6.	SQL Query Execution
	‚Ä¢	Learned how to use PreparedStatement and ResultSet to securely execute queries and retrieve results.
	7.	Polymorphism with DB Integration
	‚Ä¢	Integrated the existing Account, CreditAccount, and DebitAccount models into a DB-backed system.
	8.	Realistic Banking Simulation
	‚Ä¢	System mimics real-world scenarios like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and account deletion through database persistence.

üëâ In short, the main achievement of this project was linking the object-oriented banking system with a relational database (PostgreSQL) using JDBC, while following clean code practices and modular design.

Do you also want me to prepare a ready-to-use paragraph summary (like for a resume/project report) that you can directly put?
